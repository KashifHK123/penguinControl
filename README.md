# 🐧control

Hosting control panel for Ubuntu/Debian web servers written in PHP with the Laravel framework.

Originally written for [a student organisation at Thomas More Kempen](https://sinners.be/), and currently in the process of being ported to Laravel 5, translated to English, and functionality specific to said student organisation's needs either being turned into something more general-purpose or removed.
